            [body_html] => <p>Maxi Health ResearchÂ® has combined calcium citrate with magnesium, vitamin D3, and boron, to give you the supplement that you have been looking for.</p><p>Cal-Maxâ¢ uses the Calcium Citrate form of calcium, itâs included for better bioavailability. Calcium is the most abundant and possibly most vital of all nutrients. Calcium loss is constant as the body carries on its daily functions. We all know that the bones need calcium but did you know your bones are alive? The material making up the bones is being replaced on an ongoing basis throughout your life! This is called remodeling. If remodeling does not occur according to its natural cycle, fractures and misshapen bones can result. In addition, calcium is essential for the contraction of muscles, conducting nerve impulses, and enzyme activity.</p><p>Cal-Maxâ¢ uses vitamin D3 (as cholecalciferol) which is the same thing you would get from sitting out in the sun. Itâs the most usable form for your body. For many people adequate sunshine is no longer an option. With the busy indoor schedules, requirements of religious dress, and vulnerability to skin problems, supplementation is fast becoming the method of choice for adequate vitamin D intake.</p><p>Magnesium is required for so many things, what better time is there to take it if not with your calcium?</p><p>For those who wish to take Boron along with calcium and magnesium, Cal-Max has it!</p><p>Get the four natural nutritional protectors of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D3, and boron working as a team for you! Get Cal Maxâ¢ today!</p>

            [body_html] => <p>Antioxidants are a broad group of compounds that destroy free radicals, in the body, thereby protecting against oxidative damage to cells. Free radicals are molecules with at least one unpaired electron. As a consequence, they are highly unstable and reactive, always cruising around aggressively looking for other compounds from which they can steal electrons such as DNA, fats and protein, in an effort to become stabilized.</p><p>Antioxidants also work synergistically with each other. Vitamin C, for example, recycles vitamin E that has been used up, selenium works in concert with vitamin E, zinc is needed to maintain normal blood concentrations of vitamin E, and therefore a combination of antioxidants gives you the most mileage of any antioxidant intake.</p><p>Maxi AntioX Supremeâ¢Â is unique in that it contains 22 of the finest, most potent antioxidants giving you the maximum benefits. Try it and feel the difference!</p>
